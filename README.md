## The TyP Programming Language
TyP ([/tʌɪp/], as in "type"), is a typesetting language written in Dart whose goal is to be a more lightweight and modern alternative to TeX and its many derrivatives. The goal is absolutely not to replace TeX, LaTeX and others, (I love LaTeX <3), but to have a more modern syntax that is more easily understood by newcomers.

TyP is a hobby project by me, [ErikWDev](https://www.github.com/ErikWDev), to solve the issues I had with LaTeX.
The issues I faced was, in no particular order, as follows:

* The syntax bothered me
* The compiling process was slow and required multiple runs sometimes to account for bibliography and more
* The naming conventions of macros were "inconsistent" at best.
