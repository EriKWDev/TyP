## The TyP Programming Language
*TyP* [/tʌɪp/] (like "type"), is a typesetting language written in Dart whose goal is to be a more lightweight and modern alternative to TeX and its many derrivatives. The goal is absolutely not to replace TeX, LaTeX and others, (I love LaTeX <3), but to have a more modern syntax that is more easily understood by newcomers.

TyP is a hobby project by me, [ErikWDev](https://www.github.com/ErikWDev)
